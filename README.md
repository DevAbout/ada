# Purpose

The purpose of this discord bot is to provide greetings for new users who join the server. This is a beginner project to get experience using Python and collaborate with developers.

# Implementation

This bot will be developed using Python and the [discord.py library](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#getting-started) in collaboration with devs from the [Learn To Code](https://discord.gg/Vcv5JG4u) discord server. Python was the selected language of choice as the code needs to be hosted on a raspberry pi.

# Roadmap

### Version 1

The first version (MVP) will provide a singular greeting for all new users within the welcome channel within the discord server. 

### Version 2

The second version will provide alternate greetings selected at random.

### Future Versions

TBD
